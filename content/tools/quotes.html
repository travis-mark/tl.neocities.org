                There's no grays, only white that's got grubby. I'm surprised you don't know that. And sin, young man, is
                when you
                treat people like things. Including yourself. That's what sin is.
                <br><br>
                When people say things are a lot more complicated than that, they means they're getting worried that they
                won't like the truth. People as things, that's where it starts.
