This is a collection of wisdom I wish I had sooner. John Walker's passing convinced me to compose this list.

- [The Hacker's Diet](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/) by John Walker gave me the confidence to lose weight and showed me the value of simple tracking systems you can setup in minutes.
- <a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1668446029610352641">Writing Advice from Larry McEnerney</a>
(2 videos, 10 min total) - I normally avoid videos on social media communicating things that could be expressed in
written form on a personal site; this is that good.
- Matt Mochary's [2 page summary of GTD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSfwOrlTa8kcRoHIikOBVgrZRZPxq3Sm5F7Hb21TmvQ) converts a book that might be useful in something you can implement. His [full curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FiJbYn53fTtPmphfdCKT2TMWH-8Y2L-MLqDk-MFV4s) is worth a skim but many parts aren't actionable for everyone.
- Patrick McKensie's essay on [salary negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) teaches self-respect as much as it covers prudent financial advice.
