> A good point that I’d forgotten, the most dangerous part of flying, in terms of infection, is when you are still on the ground [because the filtration systems aren’t in full effect](https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1587186956945039363). So you might want to mask until you take off, remember that Covid-19 is not the only virus out there.
