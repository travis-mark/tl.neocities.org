<p>I'm not sure why it took me so long to get get something out
    there. I don't like most of the social media platforms, and I
    always got hung up on choosing a domain and getting a server set
    up. In the end, those were just excuses, and I'm going to start
    adding stuff to this site on a semi-regular basis.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why it took me so long to get get something out
    there. I don't like most of the social media platforms, and I

    adding stuff to this site on a semi-regular basis.</p>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> was easy enough to get started with, but Iâ€™ll have to
    learn how to customize it. I'm ok with the phone layout, but I
    want my own color scheme and some other changes. My minimalist
    tendencies are a little miffed that its output is in single digit
    kilobytes instead of tens or hundreds bytes, but everything still
    loads quickly. I put a couple of stubs in place to migrate from
    the old pages to Jekyll's urls.</p>
<p>In terms of content, I'll add posts about fitness and
    professional work later, but for now I uploaded a few
    recipes. Learning how to cook more is a goal of mine this year and
    I want to build out a complete set of recipes that I can do meal
    prep with.</p>
