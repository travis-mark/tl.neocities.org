Some friends who are aware of Elon's acquistion and destruction of Twitter have asked about the value of Twitter relative to other social media like Facebook or YouTube. 

This [thread about the minor character Red Hair](https://twitter.com/hradzka/status/1611489902570639361) in the Conan the Barbarian movie is a good example:

- Facebook, et. al. are too private. 
- YouTube, et. al. force higher production content (videos) taking longer to produce / consume.

This kind of content is valuable, but not valuable enough for independent publishing which bears ongoing costs. But it is a real problem worth solving. Whether it's the right place or not, you will see [research on topics like COVID](https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1332771238771630080) and useful [news reporting / analysis](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538) shared through mediums like this until an alternative is viable.

Other options include:

- [Personal websites](https://neocities.org) are my favorite but require effort / knowledge beyond a social media post.
- [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) is a federated Twitter clone but Twitter is a poor format for Twitter's best content.
- [Medium](https://medium.com) is currently great for publishing but the paywall is less awesome for readers
- [Substack](https://substack.com) is similar to Medium but with more focus on e-mail and for now, less annoying.
- [Ghost](https://ghost.org) is less encumbered than Medium or Substack, but charges authors a monthly fee.

These options have something in common: they're all too heavyweight for the task. Meanwhile over in Twitter-land, [paying subscribers can post longer tweets](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591472/twitter-blue-subscribers-longer-tweets-4000-characters). So even Twitter understands the pain point, whatever their other issues.
