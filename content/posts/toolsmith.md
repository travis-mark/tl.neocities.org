Fred Brooks, ACM Allen Newell Award [acceptance speech](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/Toolsmith-CACM.pdf):

> Any thing which has to call itself a science isn’t. By this criterion, physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy may be sciences; political science, military science, social science, and computer science are not. 

> We make things that do not themselves directly satisfy human needs, but which others use in making things that enrich human living. In a word, the computer scientist is a toolsmith—no more, but no less. It is an honorable calling.

You will be missed.
