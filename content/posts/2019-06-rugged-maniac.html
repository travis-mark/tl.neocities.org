<p>Rugged Maniac was good enough to forward a Men's Health article
    outlining a training approach. The article prompted this post; in
    my experience, people are unwilling to adapt a training regimen to
    fit a pre-existing (and busy!) schedule.</p>
<p>Preparing for an event with just a month isn't ideal, but you
    have to work within the time you have. To that end, I'm going to
    do two workouts a day. I'm also making some compromises to fit
    within my existing schedule / activities:</p>
<h2>Warmup (before each morning routine)</h2>
<p>Repeat for 3 minutes</p>
<ul>
    <li>5 pushups
    <li>5 air squats
    <li>5 situps
</ul>
<h2>Morning Routine A (Crossfit)</h2>
<p>Do each workout for 40 seconds, rest 20 seconds, repeat 6 times.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bear Crawl
    <li>Gorilla Hang Pullup
    <li>Plank to Elbow Touch
    <li>Dumbbell Thruster
    <li>Spiderman Pushup
    <li>Dumbbell Row
</ul>
<h2>Morning Routine B (Yoga)</h2>
<p>Hold positions for the time listed below. Do 5 reps of each
    position. Breathe in for 5 seconds and out for 5 seconds. Continue
    breathing during transitions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hands to Heart (6 breaths)
    <li>Mountain (10 second hold, 5 neutral, 5 each arm)
    <li>Tree (1 min hold each leg)
    <li>Down dog / Upward Facing Dog (10 sec hold),
    <li>Cat / Cow pairs (5 seconds each)
    <li>Broken Table (1 min each side)
    <li>Sun Salutation A (5 seconds each position: Mountain,
        Extended Mountain, Fold Forward, Halfway Lift, Chaturanga, Upward
        Facing Dog, Downward Facing Dog, Step Forward, Fold Forward, Halfway
        Lift, repeat) Warrior 2, Triangle, Warrior 2, Reverse, Warrior 1, Fold
        Forward, Warrior 1, repeat (5 seconds each position) - do left foot
        forward for 5 sets then do right foot forward for 5 sets
    <li>High Boat / Low Boat (15 seconds each position)
    <li>Wheel (15 second hold)
    <li>Supta Baddha Konasana (1 rep, 30 sec)
    <li>Corpse Pose (1 rep, 2 mins)
</ul>
<h2>Afternoon Routine (Cardio)</h2>
<p>Running is familiar to me, but I want to cross-train for a future triathlon.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Swimming, 2x week
    <li>Biking, 2x week
    <li>Running, 3x week
</ul>
<h2>Combined</h2>
<p>This is the resulting schedule:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>Monday</td>
        <td>Tuesday</td>
        <td>Wednesday</td>
        <td>Thursday</td>
        <td>Friday</td>
        <td>Saturday</td>
        <td>Sunday</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>AM</td>
        <td>Routine A</td>
        <td>Routine B</td>
        <td>Routine A</td>
        <td>Routine B</td>
        <td>Routine A</td>
        <td>Routine B</td>
        <td>Rest</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PM</td>
        <td>Swimming</td>
        <td>Running</td>
        <td>Biking</td>
        <td>Running</td>
        <td>Swimming</td>
        <td>Biking</td>
        <td>Rest</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<h2>Adjustments</h2>
<p>Routine A is still a challenge for me, I'm starting out with
    5-pound dumbbells and doing 2, 3, 4 and 5 sets the first four
    days. I strongly recommend making similar adjustments as you ramp
    up. Because the first few days leave extra time, I'm filling it
    with house work to maintain the schedule and keep moving.</p>
