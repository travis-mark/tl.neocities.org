title: "The Darker Path"
type: "section"
---

A creeping darkness has begun to plague the Central Flanaess, drawing the attention of both commoners and sages alike. In the [Free City of Greyhawk](/tdp/free-city-of-greyhawk), merchants unknowingly peddle cursed trinkets and tainted relics to unsuspecting customers, while in the poor quarter, a charismatic preacher draws growing crowds with sermons about embracing the dark and finding truth in the absence of light. 

What begins as a simple investigation into these seemingly unrelated events will lead down a path to uncover an ancient force plotting a full invasion of Oerth, where the spreading darkness is merely an echo of a deeper power to come.
