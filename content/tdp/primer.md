## Important Names

A handful of important names are defined below:

**Oerth** (pronounced _orth_ or _oyth_) is the world of Greyhawk. It has four continents, four oceans, and a plethora of islands and seas.

**Oerik** (pronounced _or_-ick or _oy_-rick) is one of Oerth’s continents.

**Eastern Oerik**, the vast region explored in this chapter, is home to many powerful nations and some of the D&D game’s most famous dungeons and adventurers.

**The Flanaess** (pronounced flah-_nay_-ess or _flay_-nayz) is another name for Eastern Oerik and means “land of the Flan.” The region’s first human settlers and their descendants are known as the Flan.

**Greyhawk** is an independent city in Eastern Oerik that attracts large numbers of adventurers. Greyhawk doubles as the name of the campaign setting.
